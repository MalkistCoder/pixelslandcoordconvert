# Pixels.Land Coordinate Converter

This is a program that converts pixels.land's old coordinate system into the new one to aid old players trying to find their art.

## Usage

Enter your old coordinates in the X & Y input boxes. If your art was in the nether, check the nether checkbox. The coordinates below will automatically update to use the new coordinate system.
